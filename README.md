# GitHub Home Test

A simple web application listen to events from GitHub on creation of new repositories.

## Design:

<img src="./github-hometest.png" width=75% height=75%>

An event of new repository creation in GitHub organization triggers a webhook that sends POST REST call with json payload to webhook endpoint service hosted on Heroku app environment. Go web application running in Heroku environment receives POST api call with json payload body which process the payload and invoke REST calls to GitHub to create branch protection rule and an issue within newly created repository.

- ### Deployment design
It uses [Heroku Dynos](https://www.heroku.com/dynos) platform to host web applicaton. Heroku provides [GitHub integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) to trigger automatic deployment on commits. Developers push updated code to repository, trigger the deployment in Heroku which run build on updated code and then release to Dynos platform.

- ### Application design
Small web application receives subscribed organization events (i.e repository changes) from GitHub through a [webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks) integration. Web application, is written in Golang, accepts [Repository events](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#repository) and filter `"action": "created"` event that indicates a new repo is created in the organization. It is then proceed with below two actions,
1. [Create branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#update-branch-protection) to `main` branch
2. [Create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue) within new repository outlines that branch protection is enabled

## Pre-requisites:
- [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/)
- [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)
- [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) - select scopes `repo:status` and `public_repo`
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    
## Deployment:
1. Create Heroku account
2. Install Heroku cli on Mac 
> Go [Here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) for installing on Windows  
> Note: Heroku requires Git. If you donâ€™t already have Git installed, please [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) before Heroku CLI  
```
$ brew tap Heroku/brew && brew install Heroku
```
3. Login to Heroku using cli 
```
$ heroku login -i
```
4. Create Heroku application
```
$ heroku create 
```
>This will generate a random APPNAME, please take down the APPNAME for future steps.
5. Setup environment variables
```
$ export TOKEN="XXXXXXX"
$ heroku config:set TOKEN=$TOKEN --app [APPNAME]
```
6. Setup GitHub integration with Heroku application
  - Login to [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com)
  - [Configure GitHub integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) with newly created Heroku application
    - >Note: You need to enable third party access inside organization settings if this needs to configure with organization
  - Run manual deploy for first time and setup automatically deployment for `main` branch
7. Test home page is accessible
```
$ curl https://[APPNAME].herokuapp.com
```
8. Configure webhook in GitHub
  - Go to: Org Settings -> Webhooks -> Add Webhook -> Enter
    - Payload URL: https://[APPNAME].herokuapp.com/webhook
    - Content type: application/json
    - Triggers: Repositories

9. Test by creating new public repository in the organization
  - Create a new repository
    - Select **Public** repository
    - Select **Add a README file**
  - Check the issues are created and branch protection is set in the repository

## Local build and test:
1. Checkout repository locally
```
$ git clone git@github.com:nidhish-org/hometest.git
$ cd hometest
```
2. Setup environment variables
```
$ export PORT=8080
$ export TOKEN="XXXXXXX"
```
3. Run unit test
```
$ go test -cover -v ./...
```
4. Build and run application locally
```
$ go build -o hometest main.go
$ chmod 755 hometest
$ ./hometest
```
5. Test application running
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
```
